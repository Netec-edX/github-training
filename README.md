### Your Team Assignment
You are part of the graphic design team for the [Hipster School online academy](https://netec-edx.github.io/github-training/). You and your team members have created a hip landing page for your online academy and have submitted the site to the digital division's director for approval. Unfortunately the director rejected two items on your landing page:
* She hates the text color of the site's title
* She doesn't believe that an image of Justin Beiber accurately portrays the identity of a modern hipster and so she has requested that you replace the Beiber image with this image of a [pair of vintage roller skates](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Netec-edX/github-training/master/images/hipster-skates.jpg). You will work in a team environment to make these changes to the site, and then re-submit your completed changes; all using Github. The two changes are to be made as follows:
1. Edit the site's [main CSS style sheet](https://github.com/Netec-edX/github-training/blob/master/css/styles.css) on row 6.

```/*------------------------------------------------------------------
 FOR COURSE: Change the "color" attribute from green to #5F152C
 ------------------------------------------------------------------*/
#site-name {
  font-family: 'Lora', serif;
#  color: 	#5F152C;
  color: 	green;
  font-size: 2em;
  font-weight: 900;
  margin: auto;
}
/*------------------------------------------------------------------
 END: FOR COURSE
 ------------------------------------------------------------------*/
```

2. Change the image URL for the course "How to be Unique" by editing row 58 of [index.html](https://github.com/Netec-edX/github-training/blob/master/index.html)

```      <section id="section-unique">
        <div class="col-md-4 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
          <div id="course-tile">
            <span><h3>How To Be Unique</h3></span>
            <!-- For course: change this image to images/hipster-skates.jpg ---->
            <img src="images/not-a-hipster.jpg">
            <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
            <p id="course-tile">DIY biodiesel small batch. Banh mi chicharrones lyft, retro you probably haven't heard of them lumbersexual la croix meh vaporware cardigan messenger bag.
